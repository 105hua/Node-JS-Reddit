# Node-JS-Reddit : A collection of Node.JS scripts that pull random posts from reddit.

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to provide random scripts that get random posts such as reddit.


The following list is what each and every JavaScript file in this repository does:
- horror.js : When ran, will return a two second horror story.
- terraria.js : When ran, will return a post from r/Terraria
- universal.js : When ran, will ask for a subreddit name and return a random post from that subreddit, should it exist.



The npm package "got" is required to run these scripts. You can get it by typing "npm i --save got" in your console.
